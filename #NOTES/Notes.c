/*

1) Array are passed by reference in a function. (Address of the array is passed)

2) Structures are passed by value in a function. (A copy of structure is created)

3) There are two ways to access the elements of a structure using a structure pointer:
    (i). using * and dot(.) operator  [ex: (*hi).hello]
    (ii). using arrow (->) operator   [ex: hi->hello]
    NOTE: - arrow operator is used only with pointer, not to access elements of a structure. (dot operator is used to access elements of structure).
